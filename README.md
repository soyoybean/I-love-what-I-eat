# I love what I eat

An app to help people who had/have issues with eating disorders to develop/settle with a personalized, healthy meal plan.

## Project Status
Development in process and ongoing.

## Installation

## The Motivation
Seeing my friends/ family members struggle with eating disorders, I wanted to help them by developing an app
that would help them maintain a healthy eating habit not by themselves, but with people around them who can support their journey.

## Research

This youtube [video](youtube.com/watch?v=8ut3rxb1nwc) gave a breakthrough.

The biggest problems are that
1. They don't seek/get treatment
2. Even if they do, they have to overcome a massive gap in the support 
available in order to fully recover.

Apps to checkout:
- RR: Eating Disorder Management
- ANAD

Ideas:
- Eating reminder (eat three proper meals)
- I hope you look forward to the day you can confidently delete this app, and
go live your life without thinking about the bad times.
- Choose a flavor/food you're craving and recommend dishes you can make/order
- Instead of setting overly ambitious goals, write your fears down
- Mindfulness activities that will help you process negative feelings
- Take a selfie everyday: you'll see that after all, you are you.
- Food blog/vlog 
- Depending on user's mood, bot says "hey, what's up?" in a different tone.
