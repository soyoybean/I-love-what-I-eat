## The Motivation
Dear Helena,

I hope this app can help you. You're the best foodie friend I ever had and ever will, so have pride
in your taste of food and love yourself. 
I hope by the time you get this app on your phone we already have lots of more memories making/eating
good food.
Sorry for being an imperfect human being, and I love you!

Best,
Soyon Kim
