## The Motivation
Dear Helena,

I hope this app can help you. You're the best foodie friend I ever had and ever will, so have pride
in your taste of food and love yourself. 
I hope by the time you get this app on your phone we already have lots of more memories making/eating
good food.
Sorry for being an imperfect human being, and I love you.

Best,
your one and only little sister
Soyon Kim

## Research

This youtube [video](youtube.com/watch?v=8ut3rxb1nwc) gave a breakthrough.

The biggest problems are that
1. They don't seek/get treatment
2. Even if they do, they have to overcome a massive gap in the support 
available in order to fully recover.

Ideas:
- Eating reminder (eat three proper meals)
- I hope you look forward to the day you can confidently delete this app, and
go live your life without thinking about the bad times.
- Choose a flavor/food you're craving and recommend dishes you can make/order
- Instead of setting overly ambitious goals, write your fears down
- Mindfulness activities that will help you process negative feelings
- Take a selfie everyday: you'll see that after all, you are you.
- Food blog/vlog 
- Depending on user's mood, bot says "hey, what's up?" in a different tone.
